# StelloPay

## 🚀 Overview
**StelloPay** is a decentralized payroll management system built on the **Stellar blockchain**. It aims to revolutionize salary payments by providing **secure, automated, and cost-effective** cross-border transactions. Our platform ensures transparency, reduces transaction fees, and enables instant salary disbursements in **XLM, USDC, and other Stellar-based assets**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional payroll systems suffer from:
- **High transaction fees**: Bank transfers and international remittances are expensive.
- **Slow processing times**: Salaries take days to process, especially for cross-border payments.
- **Lack of transparency**: Employers and employees have limited visibility into transactions.
- **Limited accessibility**: Many employees, especially in remote areas, lack access to banking services.

## 🌟 Our Solution
StelloPay leverages **blockchain technology** to:
✅ Automate payroll processing based on predefined schedules.
✅ Enable instant and low-cost salary payments via Stellar.
✅ Support multiple currencies, including **XLM, USDC, and stablecoins**.
